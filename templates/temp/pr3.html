         </header>
		   	
		    <p> The newton's eye is one of the leading security providing company in india with a prime goal to secure the data
               that is valuable to our customers.We are one of the leading brands when it comes to online security services.
               Newton's eye was established back in 2011 when the founder and CEO Aakash Upadhyay thought to solve the problem
               of big companies and households where the security problems are a major concern.When Newton's eye came into market
               it created a huge impact in the security providing services based sector with its new ways to provide the security
               centrally with a prime objective to centralise all the areas to be monitored under one roof.With the vision of 
               Aakash Upadhyay Newton's eye has been a huge success in the security industry and impacting a lot of people with
               a prime objective to keep its customers tension free !!!  </p>
			   
			   <p>  In order to upgrade the above diversified services, we researched and developed “A Service of Centralised 
			   Security System on Intelligent Network”,which is a home security and diversified service control network 
			   architecture. It is based on the TCPiIP standard communication protocal. The network also contains Intelligent 
			   Network Components such as: Service Control Node (SCN), Service Management System (SMS) and Service Creation 
			   Environment (SCE), and is capable carrying out distributed operation execution. As the network complies with 
			   the standard communication protocol, it is adaptable to the multi-vendor environments(MVE) of composite 
			   components, as well as capable of providing intelligent network services.</p>
			   
			   <p> “A Service of Home Security System on Intelligent Network (HSSIN)” was developed for the requirements of the
			   APX - Home Security System (APX-HSS) [13], its single-component system is capable of simultaneously attending 
			   to 2,000 homes and may be expanded without limits. In order to expand the monitoring and service quality, it is
			   suggested that there should be around 20,000 homes in each locality, as four localities (80,000 homes)form one
			   HSSIN management. The APX-HSS architecture is shown in Figure 1 [13]. It contains three principal parts: 
			   <ul>
			   <li>(A) User terminal : Terminal Control Unit.<li>
			   <li>(B) The equipment of the telephone company: the telephone exchange network and the private line system. </li>
               <li>(C) Monitoring center equipment: monitoring computer and Central Network Control Unit (CNCU).</li>
               </ul>
